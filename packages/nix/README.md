# Nix Utilities

This directory contains our custom nix modules that are
included in both our local development environment
and our CI runners via `devenv`
(see [devenv.nix](../devenv.nix)).

These modules generally fall into one of the following
buckets:

- helper bash scripts
- pinned binary versions
- wrapped binaries
